//An object that has the same name as a class is called a companion object of the class,
// and it is often used to contain factory methods for the class that it complements.

class Movie(val name: String, val year: Short)

object Movie {
  def academyAwardBestMoviesForYear(x: Short) = {
    //This is a match statement, more powerful than a Java switch statement!
    x match {
      case 1930 => Some(new Movie("All Quiet On the Western Front", 1930))
      case 1931 => Some(new Movie("Cimarron", 1931))
      case 1932 => Some(new Movie("Grand Hotel", 1932))
      case _ => None
    }
  }
}


//A companion object can also see private values and variables of
// the corresponding classes' instantiated objects:
class Person(val name: String, private val superheroName: String) //The superhero name is private!

object Person {
  def showMeInnerSecret(x: Person) = x.superheroName
}
